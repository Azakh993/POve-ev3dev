## Background
This project is part of the course Engineering Methodology II1300, in which participants gain knowledge and experience in project methodology, group dynamics, project management, project tools, and project work.

## Purpose
The purpose of the project is to produce a LEGO robot capable of orienting itself, navigating to pre-programmed points, and assisting in mail delivery.

The effect goal is for this robot to assist in distributing mail to various addresses, thereby reducing the need for human resources for this task. The internal goal of the project group is for all project members to gain a sufficiently good understanding of project work so that they can individually manage a smaller IT project in the future.
